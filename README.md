# Networked-AFrame 0.7.1(!) OPEN-EasyRTC Adapter

Network adapter for [networked-aframe](https://github.com/networked-aframe/networked-aframe) that uses EasyRTC for the WebRTC framework.

As of 0.7, the existing easyrtc adapter was deprecated in favor of a raw-webrtc implementation that was built-in. Unfortunately, that adapter is deeplly problematic to the point of being completely dysfunctional. Doubly unfortunately, the project thereafter immediately lost its maintainer.

This fork implements the updates given by [open-easyrtc](https://github.com/open-easyrtc/naf-easyrtc-adapter/tree/open-easyrtc) in an [unaccepted pull request](https://github.com/networked-aframe/naf-easyrtc-adapter/pull/2), and then goes and updates the demo which was severely out of date (like, 3 years out of date) to work with modern aframe (1.0.4) and networked aframe (0.7.1).

## What have I changed?

Not much, in the demo you'll find:

- this is the current basic-audio demo from the networked-aframe main master repo demos from 0.7.1,
- with aframe bumped up from 1.0.3 to 1.0.4,
- with open-easyrtc added as per the pull request on the NAF easyrtc adapter repo,
- with the socket.io source from the same pull request included,
- and with the package.json updated to include the relevent repos
- and with the adapter switched to 'easyrtc'
